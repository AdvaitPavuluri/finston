‚ùó It is important to note that programs written in VEXcode V5 will save as a `.v5python` file instead of a  `.py` file. If this type of file is pushed to GitHub, it will look like [this](https://github.com/AdvaitPavuluri/VEX_Controller_Code/blob/main/VEX_Controller.v5python). 

The fix for this issue is to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) along with the [VEX Robotics extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VEXRobotics.vexcode). This is the superior method of coding with VEX equipment‚ÄîI simply do not see any advantages for using VEXcode over VS Code.
